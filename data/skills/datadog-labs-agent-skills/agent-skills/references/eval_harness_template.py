"""Skeleton for `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py`.

Copy this into `.auto_experiment/eval_harness.py` in iteration 1, then fill in the two TODOs:
`generate_output` (run the REAL code under test) and `judge` (a REAL LLM-as-judge call).

Hard rules (see references/rubrics.md):
  * NO score literals / hard-coded score arrays anywhere in this file. Every score is returned
    by `judge()` running over real data.
  * Score only scoreable target lines; EXCLUDE non-target/infra lines from the mean entirely
    (do not score them 0). The runner below skips a line when `generate_output` returns None.
  * The harness is written ONCE and reused verbatim across iterations — only the code under
    test (imported by `generate_output`) changes between iterations.

Usage: `python .auto_experiment/eval_harness.py`  -> writes eval_results.jsonl, prints
  {"mean", "stdev", "reps", "scored", "excluded", "rep_means"}.

Noise: `generate_output` (and an LLM judge) are stochastic, so a single run's mean is a
noisy estimate. The runner re-runs the WHOLE eval `AUTO_EXP_REPS` times (default 3) and
reports the mean-of-reps plus the across-rep stdev — the loop uses that stdev as the
noise floor for keep/discard (see references/rubrics.md "Noise & keep/discard policy").
Point at a specific data split with `AUTO_EXP_DATA` (default data.jsonl).
